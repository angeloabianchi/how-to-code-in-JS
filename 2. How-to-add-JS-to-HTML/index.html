<!-- Adding JavaScript into an HTML Document -->
<!-- You can add the HTML tag <script>.
The <script> tag can be placed in the <head>, <body> or after the </body> close tag, depending on when you want the JS load.
Generally, the code can go inside <head>, however, if your script needs to run at a certain point within a page’s layout,
you should put it at the point where it should be called, usually within the <body> section. -->



<!-- Working with a Separate JavaScript File -->
<!-- The benefits of using a separate JavaScript file include:

    1. Separating the HTML markup and JavaScript code to make both more straightforward
    2. Separate files makes maintenance easier
    3. When JavaScript files are cached, pages load more quickly -->
<!-- Let’s create a small web project to connect JS document to an HTML document. -->

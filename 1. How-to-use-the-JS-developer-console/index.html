<!-- WORKING IN THE CONSOLE -->
<!-- The JavaScript Console provides you with a space to try out JavaScript code in real time by letting
 you use an environment similar to a terminal shell interface. -->
<!-- alert("Hello, World!");                              This will see the alert popup in the browser -->
<!-- console.log("Hello, World!");                        Within the console, will be printed the message Hello, World! -->
<!-- console.log(2 + 6);                                  Using JS to perform math. Output = 8 -->
<!-- We can work with multiple lines with variables:
let d = new Date();
console.log("Today's date is " + d);                      output - Today's date is Wed Jun 21 2017 15:49:47 GMT-0400 (EDT) -->
<!-- We can also go on to modify the style of the page, such as the background color:
document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";        output - "lightblue" -->
<!-- As well as the color of the text on the page:
document.body.style.color = "white";                      output- "white" -->



<!-- DOM - Document Object Model -->
<!-- The DOM is a tree of Objects and shows the HTML elements within a hierarchical view. The DOM Tree is available to view
within the Inspector panel in Firefox or the Elements panel in Chrome.
These tools enable you to inspect and edit DOM elements and also let you identify the HTML related to an aspect of a particular
page. The DOM can tell you whether a text snippet or image has an ID attribute and can let you determine what that attribute’s
value is.
You will see CSS styles in a side panel or below the DOM panel, allowing you to see what styles are being employed within the
HTML document or via a CSS style sheet. -->



<!-- NETWORT -->
<!-- The Network tab of your browser’s built-in development tools can monitor and record network requests. This tab shows you
the network requests that the browser makes, including when it loads a page, how long each request takes, and provides the
details of each of these requests. This can be used to optimize page load performance and debug request issues. -->



<!-- RESPONSIVE DESIGN -->
<!-- When websites are responsive, they are designed and developed to both look and function properly on a range of different
devices: mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and laptops. -->
